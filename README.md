# Reverse_String

A simple web application that reverses any text input. Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Real-time string reversal**: Enter any text and see it reversed instantly
- **Clean, responsive design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Simple and intuitive**: Easy-to-use interface with minimal distractions
- **No dependencies**: Pure vanilla JavaScript - no frameworks or libraries required

## How it works

The application uses JavaScript's built-in string methods:
1. `split("")` - converts string to array of characters
2. `reverse()` - reverses the array order
3. `join("")` - joins the reversed characters back into a string

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser
2. Type or paste text in the input field
3. Click the "Reverse" button
4. View the reversed result below
